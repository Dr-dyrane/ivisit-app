# Notification Sounds

This directory should contain notification sound files.

## Required Files

- `notification-urgent.mp3` - For URGENT priority notifications (loud, attention-grabbing)
- `notification-high.mp3` - For HIGH priority notifications (moderate alert)
- `notification-normal.mp3` - Optional, currently not used
- `notification-low.mp3` - Optional, currently not used

## Recommendations

- Keep files under 50KB each
- Use MP3 format
- Duration: 0.5-2 seconds
- Free sources: Pixabay, Mixkit, Orange Free Sounds

## Note

The app will function without these files (haptics only). Sound files are optional but enhance the notification experience.
