## Installation

To set up iVisit locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/ivisit-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ivisit
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

5. Use these commands to generate a production-ready APK or submit to the Play Store:

    ```bash
    eas build --platform android
    eas build -p android --profile preview2
    ```

    - The `preview2` profile in `eas.json` is configured to generate APK files. You can modify this profile to suit different build needs.

6. **OTA (Over-the-Air) Updates with EAS**:

   After the APK has been generated and deployed, you can push over-the-air updates (such as JavaScript or asset changes) without requiring users to download a new version from the Play Store.

   To send an update to all users:

   ```bash
   eas update
   eas update --branch preview2
   ```

   This will push your latest changes to users who have installed your app.

   ### Key Notes:

- **`eas update`** allows you to update the app without needing a full rebuild and Play Store re-submission. Ideal for minor fixes or improvements.
- Ensure that `expo-updates` is installed and properly configured to enable OTA updates in your app.
