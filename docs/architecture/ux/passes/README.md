# UX Issues — Pass Index

**Source plan:** [../UX_ISSUES_SUBPASS_PLAN_2026-05-10.md](../UX_ISSUES_SUBPASS_PLAN_2026-05-10.md)
**Source issue register:** [../IVISIT_UX_ISSUE_MAPPING_AND_LOCATION_GUARDRAILS_2026-05-10.md](../IVISIT_UX_ISSUE_MAPPING_AND_LOCATION_GUARDRAILS_2026-05-10.md)
**Carries forward from:** `PRE_TRACKING_PHASE_AUDIT_2026-04-27_FINAL.md` deferred items C-1 through C-6

## Guiding Principle

The map surface is persistent, the sheet changes mode, chrome floats above both. No pass may break that contract.

## Pass Table

| Pass | Track | Title | Issues | Priority | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| [UX-A](./UX_A_DECISION_SURFACE_LAYOUT.md) | Frontend / Layout | Decision Surface Layout | 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, §1.5 | **HIGH** | **SHIPPED 2026-05** |
| [UX-B](./UX_B_VISUAL_HIERARCHY.md) | Frontend / Quality | Visual Hierarchy + Transition Discipline | 4, 5, 10, 12 | MEDIUM | **SHIPPED 2026-05** |
| [UX-C](./UX_C_PAYMENT_SURFACE.md) | Frontend / Payment | Payment Surface HIG Polish | 8, C-5, C-6/PT-7, C-6/PT-11, C-6/UX-5, C-6/UX-6 | **HIGH** | **SHIPPED 2026-05** |
| [UX-D](./UX_D_STATE_LAYER.md) | State / Architecture | State Layer Completion | 9, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 | MEDIUM | **SHIPPED 2026-05** |
| [UX-E](./UX_E_LOCATION_SHEET.md) | Frontend / Location | LocationSheet + Mini Profile | 11 | LOW | **SHIPPED 2026-05** |

## Pass Order and Dependencies

```
UX-A (layout, triage)
  ↓
UX-B (hierarchy, transitions)   ← review in sequence with A; shares some files
  ↓
UX-C (payment polish)           ← must catalogue isSubmitting consumers for D
  ↓
UX-D (state architecture)       ← highest blast radius; do last in main sequence
  ↓
UX-E (location — blocked)       ← unblocks only after Location passes ship
```

UX-A and UX-B may be worked in parallel on non-overlapping file sets but must be reviewed in sequence before merge.

## Pre-Flight Line Count

Files that are already near or over architecture limits before any pass begins:

| File | Lines | Target | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `MapBedDecisionStageParts.jsx` | 899 | max 450 | ðŸš¨ Exceeds |
| `MapAmbulanceDecisionStageParts.jsx` | 746 | max 450 | ðŸš¨ Exceeds |
| `MapCommitPaymentStageParts.jsx` | 898 | max 450 | ðŸš¨ Exceeds |
| `useMapCommitTriageController.js` | 603 | max 300 | ðŸš¨ Exceeds |
| `MapBedDecisionStageBase.jsx` | 467 | max 500 | ⚠ï¸ Near limit |

**Extraction rule:** If any UX-A/B/C change pushes a StageParts file past 950 lines, extract the new component into a named sub-file. Do not create standalone files for pure style extractions.
